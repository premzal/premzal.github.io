            <b>What is it?!</b><br>
            SprinkleBot is an SMART watering system for indoor household plants!<br>
            Caregiving for home plants can be a huge resposibility to keep up with especially when we are busy.<br>
            Why not delate a task to an automated system that will take care of this resposibility for you!

            Motivation
        </h1>

        <p>

            Having beautiful plants inside of a home can drastically improve the aesthetics and mood within a home.<br>
            We ourselves have first-hand experience witnessing plants die and wither from dehydration, and an automated system can solve this issue.<br>

        </p>

        <h1>
            How it Works?!
        </h1>

        <p>
            The heart of the system is a microtroller that will use sensors to determine when waterning is necesasry. <img src="system.png" alt="Flowchart" width="500" height="333">

            Benefits of the Product 
        </h1>

        <p>
            The benefits of our product is that it removes the guess work of WHEN to and HOW much to properly 
            water plants. By having an automated system it will prolong the plants life.
